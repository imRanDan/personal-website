# Personal-Website

My personal website. It features who I am, what I do, and how to contact me. I also list some of the projects I've worked on there and other interests. I make small updates here and there!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Created with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Designed for desktop and mobile devices.

I had worked on one section at a time. Originally a pure static website, I added in the CSS animations afterwards. No templates, I used coolers color scheme to get the colors I wanted. I used some photos from pexels copyright free images. 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

There is so much more to be added. I see my website as a place to showcase what I've learned. The more technologies and methods I learn, I will add an element of that to my website. More to be added. The navbar functionality is pretty glitchy so that is something I need to work on. I do have some missing project squares which I will get around to filling in.

## Lessons Learned:

designing it from scratch and implementing it as a fully working website viewable to all is putting all the skills learned to the test. Anyone with the link or who searches my full name into google will be able to see my website. I have found that keeping it simple is what worked best for me and the website. It has gone through many iterations and I had moments of whether or not I should use React or another tech to get it looking good. For now I wanted to get something up and running and focus on improvements later.
