             <p>My name is Danyal Imran, and I am a Web Developer based out of Hamilton.
               I have a passion for creating things and embracing challenges. I am a life-long 
               student and a seeker of growth. I have a Bachelor of Arts from Wilfrid Laurier University,
              where I completed my undergrad.
                </p>
             <p>My story as a Web developer came to be during the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
               I began to teach myself how to code from various online resources and documentation. I now create
            projects based on my own liking or related to the resources I follow.</p>
